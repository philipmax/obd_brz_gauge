/*
 * vp_engine - runs a compiled vehicle profile (vp_profile_t) against an
 * ELM327: AT bring-up, request scheduling, response matching, decoding and
 * signal writes.
 *
 * Pure C, no ESP-IDF / FreeRTOS: time, transport and outputs are injected
 * through vp_engine_sink_t, so the same code runs in the firmware (driven by
 * the ELM327 BLE client task) and in the host tests (test/host/engine).
 *
 * Threading: NOT thread-safe. One task owns the engine and calls every
 * function below; the ELM327 polling stays a single-threaded, prompt-gated
 * state machine (one command in flight, the next one only after '>' or a
 * timeout).
 *
 * Driving loop (firmware):
 *     link_up() once the adapter's notify subscription is ready;
 *     loop: feed received bytes with on_rx(), then wait = run();
 *           sleep up to `wait` ms or until more bytes arrive;
 *     link_down() when the BLE link drops.
 *
 * Behaviour (contracts/vehicle-rpn.md section 3 is the decode pipeline):
 *  - bring-up: legacy profiles use the Car Scanner-style common setup
 *    (ATZ ATD ATD0 ATE0 ATH1 ATSPx ATM0 ATS0 ATAT1 ATAL), followed by profile-specific
 *    bus.init commands and one configurable check_connection request (0100
 *    by default).  A translated InitSequence that
 *    contains a reset, ATSP and all common setup commands owns the complete
 *    setup order and is sent verbatim (with DELAY/WAIT tokens represented as
 *    local waits); partial reset-bearing sequences are completed after the
 *    profile commands;
 *  - protocol auto-detect probes the supported ELM protocol numbers in a
 *    deterministic order and reuses the accepted protocol on reconnect;
 *    Auto re-probes after sustained decode failures and retains the user's
 *    Automatic selection instead of persisting a detected value as a lock;
 *    ATSP0 in profile init retains an already selected concrete protocol;
 *    otherwise ATDPN resolves adapter-selected protocols before polling;
 *  - rounds: the current request of every due signal (round / slow every
 *    div rounds / period_ms), each distinct request once, in signal order;
 *    "every" requests run before each slot's regular request to minimize
 *    their latency; gap_ms after each request; responsive_polling instead
 *    services demanded RPM/speed/boost/throttle before background slots
 *    (RPM/speed default to 50/100 ms; pressure/throttle run every batch),
 *    with one bounded extra RPM refresh per slot;
 *    explicit periods and slow boost/throttle rates are retained; failed
 *    requests back off up to 16 s and shared requests are deduplicated;
 *  - standard 11-bit OBD request addresses are mapped to their 29-bit
 *    equivalents on protocols 7/9, together with standard response filters;
 *    legacy protocols 1..5 keep native addressing;
 *  - a Mode 01 NRC 0x11 / 0x12 on a standard physical CAN address retries
 *    once on the protocol's functional OBD address;
 *    on_demand is polled like round;
 *  - ATSH / ATCRA / ATCEA / ATCAF0 are sent only when the adapter state
 *    differs from what the next request needs (lazy restore);
 *  - monitor probe windows (ATS1 ATH1 ATMA ... CR, ATAR, ATH0 ATS0) after a round when
 *    every_ms has elapsed; continuous mode re-enters ATMA every 5 s;
 *  - NO DATA, ?, STOPPED, CAN ERROR, negative responses and timeouts are
 *    sample failures; fail_after failures move to the next source;
 *    timed-out steps interrupt and drain to '>' before queued work resumes;
 *    a failed transport write requests reconnect before sending another line;
 *  - obd.gear derive/fallback "ratio" from rpm and speed with hysteresis;
 *  - sys.obd_link: 1 from link_up, 2 right before the first decoded write,
 *    back to 1 after link_hold_ms without a decode, 0 on link_down;
 *  - self-heal: heal_ms without a decode re-runs the bring-up; the third
 *    heal in a row asks the transport to reconnect.
 * Every generated AT command and profile init command goes through the
 * corresponding vp_at_check context before it is sent; refused commands are
 * dropped.
